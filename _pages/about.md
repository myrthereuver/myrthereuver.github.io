Hello world! I am Myrthe Reuver, a master's student specializing in Natural Language Processing, Text Mining, and Machine Learning. I am studying at the Research Master's programme "Linguistics and Communication Sciences" at Radboud University in Nijmegen and the MSc programme "Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence" at Tilburg University in Tilburg. You can download my full CV [here](/Myrthe_CV.pdf). 

Currently (from december 2019 until July-August 2020), I am doing two master thesis projects on Natural Language Processing with medical and clinical text at software compay Topicus in Deventer. Want to know more about these projects? Ask me through email or Twitter!

During my master's programme, I was founder and editor-in-chief of Radboud's [student linguistics journal RU:ts](http://ruts-journal.ruhosting.nl/), an open-access journal where students are authors, reviewers, and the editorial board. Our first edition is out on the website and in print, and we have a second edition in the pipeline for 2020!

I also completed a research internship at the Meertens Institute in Amsterdam, concerning text classification with cultural texts (specifically: urban legends). This internship led to a [conference presentation at DHBenelux 2019](http://2019.dhbenelux.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/08/DH_Benelux_2019_paper_69.pdf) in september 2019, [a popular science article](https://www.neerlandistiek.nl/2019/10/hoe-een-computer-broodjeaapverhalen-leert-categoriseren/) in Dutch in the online journal Vertelcultuur, an interactive [demo of my model](https://myrthereuver.github.io/UrbanLegendCategorizer/), and a [poster presentation](https://twitter.com/rehtrym/status/1222893742345949186/photo/1) at CLIN30 (Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands) in january 2020.

I work as a Teaching Assistant at Radboud, teaching the seminars for the bachelor course ["Information Science"](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/arts/courses/ba/ibc/b1/let-ciwb158-ibc/). My work as TA consists of lecturing on specific topics and assisting students in practical sessions, assisting main teachers with course and syllabus design, and designing and grading assignments on the workings, evaluation, and ethics of intelligent information tools (such as spell checkers) and information retrieval.

Other experience includes participation in ICT with Industry 2019, where I worked in a team of researchers on automatic keyword classification of academic texts for the KB (Dutch national library). The project resulted in a [demo](https://lab.kb.nl/tool/brinkeys-tool), and a [white paper](https://www.kb.nl/sites/default/files/docs/kb_whitepaper_exploring_possibilities_automated_generation_of_metadata_eng_online.pdf). I also made an [NWO vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m92LxE5hQ4) about the project.

I hope to continue doing interesting research in the future, where my interests lie in complex but also practically applicable text-mining research! Hopefully, I can find an interesting PhD position were to pursue this - but I am also open to other opportunities that allow me to do dive into interesting phenomena. 

If you have any ideas about what I should do (be it in the form of a PhD or otherwise), contact me! :-) I'm always interested in new ideas or opportunities!
