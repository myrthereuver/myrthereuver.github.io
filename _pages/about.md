Hello world! ⚡ I am Myrthe Reuver, a researcher specializing in computational argumentation, responsible use of AI, and interdisciplinary research - mostly in the connection between NLP and the social and political sciences. 🧩 I also enjoy presenting research outcomes to different audiences - whether in talks, papers, or reports. 👩🏻‍🏫

I defended my [dissertation](https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/422855180/182550reuverprintversiez%20-%20687e2c1a1441d.pdf) titled 🧩 "A Puzzle of Perspectives: Interdisciplinary Language Technology for Responsible News Recommendation" at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in September 2025. My research connects computational argumentation with AI, social science, real-world problems. The main focus was polarization in online news and debate. See this [video](https://youtu.be/izR19B1T-fA?si=bjbUfmQM-P2TfJgt&t=270) of my defense, starting with a 8-minute talk about my dissertation. 

During my PhD, I...
- 📝 published and presented 6 research papers on argument mining, responsible AI, and NLP in recommender systems at world-leading conferences and workshops (COLING, NAACL, Argument Mining), and co-authored 5 others as collaborator.
- 💰 obtained grants, including a Visiting Junior Researcher grant for a fully funded visit at the Data Science Methods group at GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences. This led to a paper on sexism detection in Findings of NAACL.
- 👩‍💻 succesfully completed an internship in the "Content & Creator AI Linguist" team at LinkedIn in Dublin, Ireland in the summer of 2023.
- 💬 gave invited talks about my research at several international institutes, including MilaNLP Lab @ Bocconi University, FBK in Trento, and IMS at Stuttgart University.
- Interested in more details? You can download my full academic CV [here](/CV_now.pdf). 

Currently, I am working as an AI developer at [Stedin](https://www.stedin.net/), an energy grid provider in the Netherlands, where I apply (generative) AI solutions that help the green energy transition. This includes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbots and applied research into responsible AI development, and learning a lot about AI and software development in production.

Before this and while finishing up my PhD, I worked at [Populytics](https://populytics.nl/), a spin-off from Delft University of Technology that provides analyses of citizens' opinions about policy dilemmas. I applied argument mining with local and small language models to increase the impact of citizens' opinions on policy. 🗣📢 My work, including visualizations of model outputs, featured in reports for local and national governments, including the Ministry of Climate and Green Growth.

I hope to continue doing interesting research with societal impact, where my interests are (but are not limited to): \
**-online information, argumentation, and debate**; \
**-societally responsible AI**; \
**-meta-science: scientific norms and methodology within and outside NLP**; \
**-and interdisciplinarity**!

I'm always interested in new ideas or opportunities, so please contact me if you have any! 😁

# News 

<sub>*2 October 2025* The paper ["Whose truth is it anyway? An experiment on annotation bias in times of factual opinion polarization"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19312458.2025.2562034), which was a side project with social scientists during my PhD, was published in Communication Methods and Measures.

<sub>*1 October 2025* Joined the temporary advisory board of experts for the SIDN Fund (Fund of the domain name registry of .nl), which funds responsible technology initiatives in the Netherlands. I helped to evaluate initiatives that combat online polarization in their ["From Liking to Listening" call](https://www.sidnfonds.nl/from-liking-to-listening). My PhD expertise was helpful in determining which initiatives could be impactful in combatting online polarization.

<sub>*2 September 2025* I defended my [dissertation](https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/422855180/182550reuverprintversiez%20-%20687e2c1a1441d.pdf) "𝘈 𝘗𝘶𝘻𝘻𝘭𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘗𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘱𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘴: 𝘐𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘥𝘪𝘴𝘤𝘪𝘱𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘢𝘳𝘺 𝘓𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘶𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘛𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘯𝘰𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘺 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘙𝘦𝘴𝘱𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘕𝘦𝘸𝘴 𝘙𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯" at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam! The defense was very interesting, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izR19B1T-fA) to watch a video of it with a short talk.

<sub>*1 August 2025* Started as AI developer at Stedin, an energy grid provider in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. I work on solutions with Stedin's multimodal and complex data, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbots and applied research into responsible AI development, and learn a lot about AI development in production.

<sub>*25 April 2025* Super fun to be invited for a talk at Anna Rogers' lab at IT University Copenhagen! 😁 My talk "A PUZZLE OF PERSPECTIVES: 
how to align language technology with social science and democratic goals" described how most of my projects (combined in my dissertation) show a connection between NLP, social science, real-world problems, also featuring my most recent paper at Findings of NAACL 2025! [Slides](https://myrthereuver.github.io/talks/Clean_Copenhagen_25April.pptx.pdf)

<sub> *23 January 2025* Our paper, "Tell Me What You Know About Sexism: Expert-LLM Interaction Strategies and Co-Created Definitions for Zero-Shot Sexism Detection" (with Indira Sen, Matteo Melis, and Gabriella Lapesa) was accepted into the Findings of NAACL 2025! This was the culmination of my research visit at the Data Science methods team at GESIS in Cologne! [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15392)

<sub> *6 January 2025* Started as a part-time NLP researcher and engineer at Populytics while finishing up my PhD! Populytics is a spin-off from Delft University of Technology that provides analyses of citizens' opinions about policy dilemmas, working with all kinds of Dutch local and national governments for research projects that offer citizens a direct participation in democratic processes. I used opinion mining to support Populytics's social and political science researchers.

<sub> *23 Sept 2024* The NWO project "Rethinking News Algorithms", which my PhD is part of, organized a final PhD workshop to bridge the gap between academic research and practical implementation for responsible, diverse news recommendation. The final part of the afternoon was fun as well as insightful: I led an interactive “Responsible AI” role-playing game! 🕹️ Read more in my [summary](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7254142737879388160/) of the afternoon.

<sub> *13 Sept 2024* Had a great time at the Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Political Text Analysis (CPSS) at the KONVENS conference in Vienna, where I contributed to two papers! One paper, ["A Few Hypocrites: Few-Shot Learning and Subtype Definitions for Detecting Hypocrisy Accusations in Online Climate Change Debates"](https://aclanthology.org/2024.cpss-1.4/), was co-authored with a group of PhD students I met at the ICA23 hackathon in Toronto! The other paper, [“Topic-specific Social Science Theory in Stance Detection: a Proposal and Interdisciplinary Pilot Study on Sustainability Initiatives”](https://aclanthology.org/2024.cpss-1.8/), was a long-due paper from a collaboration with Ana Isabel Lopez from the communication science department. I also wrote a brief [summary](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7244987470369423360/) of both papers and my experience at the conference.

<sub> *15 August 2024*  The first result of my GESIS research visit is published! With first author Maximilian Maurer, Julia Romberg, Negash Weldekiros, and Gabriella Lapesa we worked on a complex shared task on 𝐝𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐨-𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐚𝐥. Our solution placed third 🥉 in this shared task (part of the Argument Mining workshop) at ACL 2024. Read our [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2024.argmining-1.18/) or my [short summary](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7229145346965225474/) of the paper and task - it really connected well to many of my interests: diversity in recommendation and retrieval, argument mining, and socio-cultural context of NLP!
