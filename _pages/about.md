Hello world! ‚ö° I am Myrthe Reuver, a PhD candidate at the Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab ([CLTL](http://www.cltl.nl/)) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU). My research is about news recommender systems and specifically: diversity in news recommender systems. I use NLP to explore and promote diversity, especially those of different viewpoints, in news recommendation contexts. I'm supervised by [prof. dr. Antske Fokkens](http://wordpress.let.vupr.nl/antske/) (also connected to CLTL) and [dr. Suzan Verberne](http://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~verbernes/) (connected to LIACS at Leiden University).

My specialization is in Natural Language Processing and Text Mining, specifically in Computational Argumentation or Argument Mining. I also have a keen interest in societal and cultural implications of NLP and AI, and interdisciplinary collaborations. I completed the Research Master's programme "Linguistics and Communication Sciences" (*cum laude + with Honours*) at Radboud University in Nijmegen and the MSc programme "Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence" (*with distinction*) at Tilburg University in Tilburg. I wrote two master's theses on clinical NLP at software company Topicus, was a proud co-founder and editor-in-chief of Radboud's [student linguistics journal RU:ts](https://www.facebook.com/RUtsJournal/), and also enjoy teaching: I was TA on Information Science during my MA and have taught 'Programming in Python' as well as a research seminar on Argument Mining during my PhD. You can download my full CV [here](/CV_now.pdf). 

I hope to continue doing interesting research in the future, where my interests lie in **societally and scientifically responsible NLP in complex domains**!  Want to know more about any of my current or past projects? Ask me through email or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/myrthereuver). I'm always interested in new ideas or opportunities, so please contact me if you have any! üòÅ

# News 

<sub> *4 May 2023* Participated in the CLTL hackathon on generative models - in an excellent team with fellow PhDs Urja Khurana and Jonathan Kamp and MA student Swarupa Hardikar. We investigated a case study involving consistency in multi-lingual and multi-cultural settings, including computational subjective argumentation. More soon! 

<sub> *24 Feb 2023* Invited for a short talk, ["Cross-topic Stances and How to
Find Them (in the News)"](https://myrthereuver.github.io/talks/Groningen_talk.pdf), at the University of Groningen, with also [talks by fellow Argument Miners](https://twitter.com/myrthereuver/status/1629130401120747521) from CLTL! 

<sub>*6 to 8 Feb 2023* Participated in the [2023 HPLT winter school on Large-Scale Language Modeling](http://wiki.nlpl.eu/index.php/Community/training) in Norway, and wrote a [blog post](https://myrthereuver.github.io/posts/2023/02/winterschool-responsible/) about my personal highlights.

<sub> *11 Jan 2023* Interdisciplinary work-in-progress "Argument Mining to Analyze Reasons for (a Lack of) Trust in Sustainable Initiatives" (with Ana Isabel Lopes (communication science) and student Alessandra Polimeno (CLTL)) [got accepted](https://twitter.com/myrthereuver/status/1613308093915607040) for a talk at at ICA23 in May 2023.

<sub> *21 - 25 November 2022* Invited participant to Lorentz workshop week ["Diverse News Recommenders: from concept to implementation"](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/diverse-news-recommenders-from-concept-to-implementation.html), where I gave a [talk](https://myrthereuver.github.io/talks/LorentzCentre.pdf) on my own and master student Alessandra Polimeno's work, and participated in implementing NLP for diversity in news recommendation.

<sub> *24 November 2022* Gave a [talk](https://myrthereuver.github.io/talks/PreregisteringNLP.pdf) at the Open Science Coffee Leiden on Preregistration in NLP. I shared some of my own recent experiences and discussed preregistration with researchers from other disciplines.

<sub>*18 October 2022* Invited for a [talk](https://myrthereuver.github.io/talks/DisTrust_talk.pdf) at the [VU Network Institute Lunch Talk](https://networkinstitute.org/research/research-lunches/) on my recently funded interdisciplinary project ‚ÄúArgument Mining to Analyze Reasons for online (Dis)Trust in Sustainable Initiatives".

<sub> *Sept/Oct 2022* Teaching: taught the course Research Seminar on Argument Mining in the ReMa Human Language Technology at the Free University of Amsterdam, and gave a [guest lecture](https://myrthereuver.github.io/talks/GuestLecture_Leiden.pdf) on stance detection in the Text Mining course (part of the MSc Computer Science) at Leiden University.

<sub>*12 August 2022.* We (a team of CLTL PhDs) [won](https://twitter.com/myrthereuver/status/1558126896495427588?s=20&t=xoexA1tYJAcQYQs-ahmtfw) ü•á the [shared task](https://phhei.github.io/ArgsValidNovel/) of the [9th Argument Mining Workshop](https://argmining-org.github.io/2022/index.html#about) at COLING 2022. We combined inter-task-training on NLI, contrastive learning, & prompting for Argument Novelty and Validity prediction. Our [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.argmining-1.8/) was also published in the Proceedings. 

<sub>*8 - 19 August 2022.* Attended the [ESSLLI summer school](https://2022.esslli.eu/) in Galway, Ireland in the summer of 2022, where I followed courses on Argument Mining, Language Resource Development, and Vector-Based Semantics.

<sub>*1 July 2022.* Gave an [invited talk](https://twitter.com/MilaNLProc/status/1542891858531155968) at the [MilaNLP Lab](https://milanlproc.github.io/) at Bocconi University (Milan), where I talked about my interdisciplinary research of the past two years into viewpoint diversity in news recommendation. It was a lot of fun, with a great follow-up discussion! See my [slides](https://myrthereuver.github.io/talks/Reuver_CodingAperitivo_MilaNLP.pptx.pdf) here. 
<!-- 
<sub>*June 2022.* Following the [SIKS "Responsible AI"](https://twitter.com/myrthereuver/status/1539291270492966912) course, which had a roleplaying game where we pretended to be different stakeholders for AI used for automatic resume scanning in hiring, after an ableist hiring incident. My role: the HR department. :-)

<sub>*13 June 2022*. Received small grant (with dr. Ana Lopes from the Department of Social Science @ VU) for our interdisciplinary project "Reasons for online (dis)trust in sustainable initiatives" - financed by the Interdisciplinarity in the Digital Society VU grant.   -->

<sub> *May 2022* Gave an [interview](https://myrthereuver.github.io/_pages/ComputerIdee_Artikel.pdf) to the Dutch computer magazine Computer Idee, about my problems with the credit scoring algorithm of the National Railway (NS) and also my research project on diversity in news recommendation.
