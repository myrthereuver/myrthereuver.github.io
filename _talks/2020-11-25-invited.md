###### I was invited by course instructors (prof. dr. Martha Larson & dr. Iris Hendrickx) to talk in the MA/MSc"Text Mining" course in the master programme on Data Science and the Research Master on Linguistics. My talk was about my ResMA thesis on smoking status classification in EMRs (done at IT company Topicus). Afterwards, I discussed my research process with the students, and gave tips on what (not) to do during a master's thesis, especially a master's thesis at a company. 

##### Note: I have given very similar talks on my ResMA thesis research at both my thesis company (Topicus) and during my thesis defense at university.
