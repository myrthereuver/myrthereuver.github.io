###### I was invited by course intructors to talk about my ResMA thesis on smoking status classification in EMRs (done at IT company Topicus) to master's students in the "Text Mining" course in the masters on Data Science and the master on Linguistics. Afteerwards, we discussed my research process and I gave tips on what (not) to do during a master's thesis, especially a master's thesis in a company.
