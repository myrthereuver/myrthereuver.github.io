###### I was invited by course instructors (prof. dr. Martha Larson & dr. Iris Hendrickx) to talk about my ResMA thesis on smoking status classification in EMRs (done at IT company Topicus) to master's students in the "Text Mining" course in the masters on Data Science and the Research Master on Linguistics. Afteerwards, we discussed my research process and I gave tips on what (not) to do during a master's thesis, especially a master's thesis in a company. 

##### Note: I have given very similar talks on my ResMA thesis research at both my thesis company (Topicus) and during my thesis defense at university.
