###### This was my first peer-reviewed abstract, which I wrote on my internship project at the Meertens Institute in Amsterdam on the classification of urban legends. The Digital Humanities conference in Li√®ge was a nice conclusion to my research internship.

The extended abstract about my research project can be read [here](DH_Benelux_2019_paper_69.pdf)
