A course on the basics of information science, including the basics of information theory, information retrieval, recommender systems, and the workings, ethics, and evaluation of intelligent information tools such as spell checkers and plagiarism scanners.

My task as a Teaching Assistant (from 2017-2018 until now) under prof. dr. Martha Larson (and later dr. Hans van Halteren) was to assist in designing assignments, seminars and the syllabus as well as grading assignments and teaching the seminars, sometimes lecturing on topics as well.
