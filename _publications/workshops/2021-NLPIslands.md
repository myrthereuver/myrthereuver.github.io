##### This position paper with my advisors Antske Fokkens and Suzan Verberne is the result of the first 6 months of my PhD, reading and thinking about my role in the larger project on diversity in news recommendation. I learned about models of democracy, and the role of viewpoint diversity in these models, from my interdisciplinary colleagues. I decided to investigate how different established #NLProc tasks can be connected to the deliberative model of democracy. This work gives me a nice starting point for my experimental work.
